# 2D-Semi-interacting-particles
Animation code in julia for semi interacting particles in a 2D Well
The gas.jl contain  non interacting gas partciles in a well given by F(x,y) = x^2 + y^2
gas2.jl contains teh code for interacting gas particles. The code is not perfect.
Some particles seems have no interaction between them. Maybe something wrong with the way i have considered interaction.
The interaction energy is not considred fro the total eenrgy.
My aim was to find put how the energy is beign redistributed after a long time. i.e understand the equilibriation of a very chaotic system.
I couldn't finish it more because i got a bit busy.
